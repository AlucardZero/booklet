## OwnTracks apps

The OwnTracks apps operate in one of three modes (discussed in [scenarios](scenarios.md)], and you tell the app in which mode you want to use it.

_Public_ mode is the easiest: you don't have to configure anything. Next up is _Hosted_ mode, in which you configure your _username_, your _device name_, and the _access token_ you got when [signing up to Hosted OwnTracks](../features/hosted.md).

In _Private_ mode, you configure our iOS and Android app to access your broker.
