# TID

A _TID_ is a _tracker ID_, a two-character identifier of your chosing, your initials, say. This _TID_ is published in the [JSON payload](../tech/json.md) of each message published by OwnTracks and is meant to be used as a short identifier which is easier to read than a rather [long topic name](../guide/topics.md).

The _TID_ of your [friends](friends.md) is displayed on the OwnTracks map if you don't have an address book entry associated with that friend, and if said friend has no retained [card](card.md) published.

The _TID_ is also used by our [Pista client](../guide/clients.md) when you're about to select a track for a particular OwnTracks user.
