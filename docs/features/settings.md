Location tracking isn't easy, and people's requirements differ. You may be happy with one location report when your device moves a few kilometers, whereas the next person prefers seeing a minute-by-minute report. As described in [the introduction](../guide/whathow.md)??? OwnTracks relies on the device's operating system APIs for this information. What our apps do is to tell the operating system that they're willing to get more or fewer updates if possible. For configuring this, as well as the connection parameters to your [MQTT broker] and sundry options, we have quite a large number of settings.
